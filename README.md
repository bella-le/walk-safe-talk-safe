## Introduction
i'm like a tiny 5'1" girl and you know, sometimes i just happen to be in a shady area. and it's nice to call someone to talk you through it to make sure you're getting to your destination. sometimes you don't even have anything to talk about. but you gotta make sure someone is there for you. but if nobody is there for you, AI can pretend to be there for you and deter any shady characters from acting on anything.

## Features
* Call the AI for a fake conversation on the phone, where the AI is concerned about your safety.
